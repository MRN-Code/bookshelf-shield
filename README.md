# bookshelf-shield
Form a protective shield around your bookshelf models.
This module leverages two other great modules (bookshelf-authorization and relations) to add ACL-based authorization to bookshelf models. 

### bookshelf-authorization
Adds an `authorize` method to bookshelf models, and creates a special **User** model.
This allows you to specify when a user is authorized to perform an action on a model.

### relations
Provides an intuitive interface for storing and querying Access Conrtol Lists.
Relations is used to determine whether a user has been granted access to perform an action on the model.
